The early 1900s saw white actors donning [“yellowface”](https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america) to play some of the most prominent Asian characters, including Charlie Chan and Dr. Fu Manchu. Exaggerated “racial” features—including slanted eyes, yellow skin color, black hair, and an “Asian” accent—were common.\r

\r
\r
When Asian American actors were finally cast to play Asian characters, they were often portrayed through stereotypes, like Bruce Lee being confined to martial arts roles or Nancy Kwan repeatedly cast as a “Dragon Lady.”\r
\r
\r

\r
\r
But these days, Asian actors no longer play just stereotypes; they are full characters—love interests, superheroes, and even the modern-day American family.\r
\r
\r
Yet there’s more to it than just portraying characters—Asian Americans come from dozens of countries with even more unique ethnic identities. When the characters inaccurately portray those aspects of our identity, we notice. And it’s not just us. A [study published in 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/from-margins-to-mainstream-asians-and-pacific-islanders-in-hollywood) showed that less than 30% of Asian and Pacific Islanders feel like they are represented in the media.\r
\r
\r
That’s partially because, according to a [2023 poll by the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2023/05/08/diverse-cultures-and-shared-experiences-shape-asian-american-identities/), many Asian Americans feel more closely aligned with their specific ethnicity, like “Chinese” or “Thai”, rather than broadly “Asian.” So it’s especially exciting to see our specific customs, cuisines, and languages reflected on the big screen.\r

\r
\r
It’s difficult to judge whether a character fairly portrays a specific ethnicity, but we can assess whether an actor is of the same ethnicity as the character they portray as a baseline for representation.\r
\r
\r
To explore this actor-character mismatch further, we compiled more than 3,500 films from the 1980s to 2020s with Asian actors. We identified films where Asian actors played a major role, getting us to 500 films. From there, we filtered the list down to films where the character’s Asian ethnicity was an important part of the storyline; we wanted to focus on media where we were supposed to feel represented but didn’t due to these inaccuracies. \r
\r
\r
For example, *The Life of Pi (2012)* qualified because the protagonist, Pi, struggles with his Hindu faith and Indian heritage along with other reflections. However, *Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)* did not; while the character Dr. Bravestone is played by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, the plot does not reference the character’s Asian identity at all. \r
\r
\r
Ultimately we found **80 films** with **160 Asian actors** playing **236 characters**.\r
\r
\r
While we covered a wide breadth of movies, our criteria for sourcing movies was based on having high profile actors in a film or reaching a moderate threshold for box office earnings, so it’s very possible that we missed some movies.`,la=[{visible_years:"1982-1995",opaque_years:"1982-1995",highlight_movies:"2",text:`The first thing we noticed in our data is that Asian representation really has increased in the past few decades! \r

\r
But despite all of this recognition, that gets us back to Haimei’s original complaint: How common is it for Asian characters to be played by an actor of a different ethnicity? When we first broached this question, we immediately thought of several examples. In the popular TV show *Fresh Off the Boat*, Korean-American actor Randall Park plays a Chinese-American character. In the show Kim’s Convenience, Chinese-Canadian actor Simu Liu plays a Korean-Canadian character, Jung Kim.\r
\r
\r
So, honestly, we expected to find a plethora of mismatches.`,Ca=[{visible_years:"1982-2023",opaque_years:"1982-2023",highlight_movies:"",text:"We started with the **80 films** and **236 characters** in our dataset."},{visible_years:"1982-2023",opaque_years:"1982-2023",highlight_movies:"",characteristic_shown:"isFullyAccurate",characteristic_dim:"isPartiallyAccurate,isFullyInaccurate",text:"Out of 80 movies we looked at, **64** were cast with <span class='accurate'>complete accuracy</span>."},{visible_years:"1982-2023",opaque_years:"1982-2023",highlight_movies:"",characteristic_shown:"isFullyAccurate,isPartiallyAccurate",characteristic_dim:"isFullyAccurate,isFullyInaccurate",text:"Meanwhile, **13** movies were cast with <span class='partial_accurate'>partial accuracy</span>."},{visible_years:"1982-2023",opaque_years:"1982-2023",highlight_movies:"",characteristic_shown:"isFullyAccurate,isPartiallyAccurate,isFullyInaccurate",characteristic_dim:"isFullyAccurate,isPartiallyAccurate",text:`And only **3** out of the 80 movies were cast <span class='fully_inaccurate'>completely inaccurately</span>.\r

When our analysis found that most films were accurately cast, it was unexpected and empowering!\r
\r
\r
We also know how fragile this progress is. In 2024, racial and gender diversity in Hollywood [decreased for the first time in six years](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/hollywood-diversity-in-decline-as-moviegoers-worldwide-want-more), part of a larger trend of diminishing diversity. In a [recent interview](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/constance-wu-the-friend-movie-hollywood-diversity-rcna198408), Constance Wu said that she’s noticed that representation is becoming less important in casting. She said this could be a sign of people in Hollywood “reverting to limited imaginations of what story and characters could be.”\r
\r
\r
We’re worried about what we might be losing.\r
\r
\r
Whether it’s seeing my (Dorothy) family’s breakfast traditions reflected *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)* or watching *Didi (2024)* and commiserating with friends about growing up in immigrant households, these movies have made us feel seen. It’s the subtleties of everyday interactions that resonate with us, not the flashy shows of “representation.” \r
\r
\r
When I call my mom while trying to recreate the recipes of my childhood, or realize my Shanghainese is getting rusty because I only speak it with family, it’s easy to feel isolated in the struggle to balance my Chinese and American identities. \r
\r
\r
But seeing those experiences represented on the big screen serve as a powerful affirmation that I am not alone—and that my experiences are worth being shared and truly understood.`,fa=`Our initial datasets started with [Luminate](https://luminatedata.com/), a database for music and entertainment data that was previously part of Nielsen Media Research. We used this database to find every film featuring a popular Asian actor since 1981. Luminate Data includes information on actors' background and ethnicities, movies they were in, and details about each movie. \r
\r
\r
Using the advanced search feature, we compiled a list of “Asian Lead Cast” actors that were in production films released in theaters between 1981 and 2023. We then put together a list of all the movies these actors were in, given that the movie originated from the United States and was not a documentary or animated movie.\r
\r
\r
Our initial list returned too broad of a list, because it included actors who were solely in films that were not widely distributed. So we filtered the data based on a metric called ScreenScore—a 1-100 scoring system that measures the popularity and relevance of each actor. It considers factors such as how often the actor is searched, the significance of movies they’ve been in, and any awards they’ve received. We talked to a representative at Luminate who helped us determine that a score of 60 was a reasonable cutoff. This left us with 83 actors.\r
\r
\r
We identified all the movies where these 83 actors were a “Main Title Actor,” meaning they had a significant role in the film. We filtered out movies that had a box office debut of less than $1,000,000 USD, resulting in 371 movies.\r
\r
\r
While this methodology was good, we wanted to make sure we didn’t miss any major films. So we added films with Asian actors from the [top-50 highest-grossing films](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2025/) each year, according to IMDB. This gave us **3,582 films**. Of these 2,150 movies, there were 96 movies that ChatGPT classified as having at least one Asian main character that we then added to our list of movies, bringing it to 467 movies. \r
\r
\r
We then needed to identify the movies that not only had Asian main actors, but also storylines where Asian characters had ethnicities that mattered. While inherently a subjective process, we considered factors such as characters speaking Asian languages, interacting with family, participating in cultural or religious activities, or storylines based in Asian history. We also referenced actor interviews, movie transcripts, online articles, and our best judgement to try and categorize these films.\r
\r
\r
This brought our list from 467 to 80 movies—a huge filtering of our list, but it just showed that a huge portion of films had Asian actors but their ethnicity didn’t matter to the plot.\r
\r
\r
Our final dataset included 236 Asian characters in the 80 films played by 165 unique actors. \r
\r
\r
Now came the hard part: We needed to find the ethnicity of the actor and compare that to the ethnicity of characters. Actor profiles in Luminate had actor ethnicities and nationalities. For the few Luminate profiles that didn’t have actor ethnicities, we looked at Wikipedia, actor interviews, and other online articles. To determine character ethnicity, we looked at movie transcripts and third party journalism. When ethnicity was not explicit, we inferred based on family members, surnames, and plot context. There were some characters that did not have enough context to determine their ethnicity, so we removed them from the dataset. If an actor had at least a partial ethnicity match with a character they played, we considered that a match. There were 11 characters across six movies who we could not determine a specific ethnicity for a character, so we removed them from our data.\r
