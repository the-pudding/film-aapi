But as part of this progress, we’ve experienced exactly what Haimei felt watching *Emily in Paris*: The excitement of seeing our lives represented in popular media, only to realize that these characters fall short. Not only do these characters fail to represent who we are; they can reinforce harmful misconceptions, generalizations, and biases.`,Zi="For much of US history, this was a common experience for Asian American filmgoers. The early 1900s saw white actors donning [“yellowface”](https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america) to play some of the most prominent Asian characters, including Charlie Chan and Dr. Fu Manchu. Exaggerated ‘racial’ features—including ‘slanted’ eyes, a yellow skin color, black hair, and a mocking ‘Asian’ accent—were common.",zi="As the Asian American population grew, particularly with the passage of [the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/chinese/a-new-community), Asians became more visible in Hollywood. But when Asian actors were cast, they were often portrayed with stereotypes, like Bruce Lee being confined to martial arts roles or Nancy Kwan repeatedly cast as a ‘Dragon Lady.’",qi="To explore this further we compiled more than 3,500 films from the 1980s to 2020s with Asian actors. We winnowed it down to films where Asian actors played a major role, getting us to 500 films. From there, we filtered the list down to films where the character’s Asian ethnicity was an important part of the storyline.

And it’s not just us. A [study published in 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/from-margins-to-mainstream-asians-and-pacific-islanders-in-hollywood) showed that less than 30% of APIs feel like they are represented in the media. This is especially important when there is so little representation of our cultures to begin with. To Asian Americans, this sends the message that Hollywood—and America as a whole—still sees Asians as one big monolith.\r
\r
\r
When our analysis found that most films were accurately cast, it was unexpected and empowering!\r
\r
\r
We also know how fragile this progress is. In 2024, racial and gender diversity in Hollywood [decreased for the first time in six years](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/hollywood-diversity-in-decline-as-moviegoers-worldwide-want-more), part of a larger trend of diminishing diversity. Even so, diversity and representation aren’t just about seeing Asian actors on screen. In a [recent interview](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/constance-wu-the-friend-movie-hollywood-diversity-rcna198408), Constance Wu said that she’s noticed that representation is becoming less important in casting. She said this could be a sign of people in Hollywood “reverting to limited imaginations of what story and characters could be.”\r
\r
\r
We’re worried about what we might be losing.\r
\r
\r
Whether it’s seeing my family’s breakfast traditions reflected *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)* or watching *Didi (2024)* and commiserating with friends about growing up in immigrant households, these movies have made us feel seen. It’s not the big flashy moments that resonate with us. \r
\r
\r
When I (Dorothy) call my mom while trying to recreate the recipes of my childhood, or realize my Shanghainese is getting rusty because I only speak it with family, it’s easy to feel isolated in the struggle to balance my Chinese and American identities. \r
\r
\r
But seeing those experiences represented on the big screen serve as a powerful affirmation that I am not alone—and that my experiences deserve to be shared and truly understood.`,ra=`Our initial datasets started with [Luminate](https://luminatedata.com/), a database for music and entertainment data that was previously part of Nielsen Media Research. We used this database to find every film featuring a popular Asian actor since 1981. Luminate Data includes information on actors' background and ethnicities, movies they were in, and details about each movie. \r
\r
\r
Using the advanced search feature, we compiled a list of “Asian Lead Cast” actors that were in production films released in theaters between 1981 and 2023. We then put together a list of all the movies these actors were in, given that the movie originated from the United States and was not a documentary or animated movie.\r
\r
\r
Our initial list returned too broad of a list, because it included actors who were only in films that were not widely distributed. So we filtered the data based on a metric called ScreenScore—a 1-100 scoring system that measures the popularity and relevance of each actor. It considers factors such as how often the actor is searched, the significance of movies they’ve been in, and any awards they’ve received. We talked to a representative at Luminate who helped us determine that a score of 60 was a reasonable cutoff. This left us with 83 actors.\r
\r
\r
We identified all the movies where these 83 actors were a “Main Title Actor,” meaning they had a significant role in the film. We filtered out movies that had a box office debut of less than $1,000,000 USD, resulting in 371 movies.\r
\r
\r
While this methodology was good, we wanted to make sure we didn’t miss any major films. So we added films with Asian actors from the [top-50 highest-grossing films](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2025/) each year, according to IMDB. This gave us **3,582 films**. Of these 2,150 movies, there were 96 movies that ChatGPT classified as having at least one Asian main character that we then added to our list of movies, bringing it to 467 movies. \r
\r
\r
We then needed to identify the movies that not only had Asian main actors, but also storylines where Asian characters had ethnicities that mattered. While inherently a subjective process, we considered factors such as characters speaking Asian languages, interacting with family, participating in cultural or religious activities, or storylines based in Asian history. We also referenced actor interviews, movie transcripts, online articles, and our best judgement to try and categorize these films. For example, *The Life of Pi (2012)* qualified because the protagonist, Pi, struggles with his Hindu faith and Indian heritage along with other reflections. However, *Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)* did not. While the character Dr. Bravestone is played by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, the plot does not reference the character’s Asian identity at all. \r
\r
\r
This brought our list from 467 to 80 movies—a huge filtering of our list, but it just showed that a huge portion of films had Asian actors but their ethnicity didn’t matter to the plot.\r
\r
\r
Our final dataset included 236 Asian characters in the 80 films played by 165 unique actors. \r
\r
\r
Now came the hard part: We needed to find the ethnicity of the actor and compare that to the ethnicity of characters. Actor profiles in Luminate had actor ethnicities and nationalities. For the few Luminate profiles that didn’t have actor ethnicities, we looked at Wikipedia, actor interviews, and other online articles. To determine character ethnicity, we looked at movie transcripts and third party journalism. When ethnicity was not explicit, we inferred based on family members, surnames, and plot context. There were some characters that did not have enough context to determine their ethnicity, so we removed them from the dataset. If an actor had at least a partial ethnicity match with a character they played, we considered that a match. There were 11 characters across six movies who we could not determine a specific ethnicity for a character, so we removed them from our data.\r
