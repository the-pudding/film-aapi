{"history":"For much of US history, Asian American representation in the media was basically nonexistent. The early 1900s saw white actors donning [“yellowface”](https://www.history.com/news/yellowface-whitewashing-in-film-america) to play some of the most prominent Asian characters, including Charlie Chan and Dr. Fu Manchu. Exaggerated ‘racial’ features—including ‘slanted’ eyes, a yellow skin color, black hair, and a mocking ‘Asian’ accent—were common.","population":"However, much has changed since then. The Asian population experienced some growth throughout the 1900s, but it wasn’t until the passage of [the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/chinese/a-new-community) when Asian migration drastically accelerated. With this, demand for representation grew louder.","stereotypes":"Asian Americans became more visible in Hollywood, but their roles were often shaped by stereotypes, limiting the depth of their representation. Bruce Lee’s career was largely confined to martial arts roles, while Nancy Kwan, despite her popularity, was repeatedly cast as a ‘Dragon Lady.’","dataTransition":"From the 1970s to the 1990s, the Asian American population increased nearly fivefold. We started to see films that starred Asian actors—and American films that celebrated Asian American culture. These Hollywood productions didn’t just increase visibility of Asians, they also represented broader shifts in our culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut just because Asian actors are in a film doesn’t mean our cultures are actually being represented in a meaningful way. So, to explore this further we compiled more than 3,500 films from the 1980s-2020s with Asian actors. We found that less than 500 of those films had Asian actors in a major role. From there, we filtered the list down to films where the character’s Asian ethnicity was an important part of the storyline—and that winnowed the list to **80 films**, with **165 Asian actors** playing **236 characters**.","dataSetup":"We started with Luminate, an entertainment industry database, to find every film featuring a popular Asian actor. We also looked at the top 50 highest-grossing films from each year with Asian actors. This gave us 3,582 films. Determining which films had Asian actors in major roles reduced our list to 467 films.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then analyzed each film to see if the Asian character’s ethnicity was relevant to their character. For example, The Life of Pi (2012) qualifies because the protagonist, Pi, struggles with his Hindu faith and Indian heritage along with other reflections. However, Jumanji: The Next Level (2019) did not. While the character Dr. Bravestone is played by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, the plot does not reference the character’s Asian identity at all.","start":[{"visible_years":"1982-1995","opaque_years":"1982-1995","highlight_movies":"2","text":"Through the late 1960s, Hollywood was still using white actors in “yellowface” to portray Asian people.

And it’s not just us. A [study published in 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/from-margins-to-mainstream-asians-and-pacific-islanders-in-hollywood) showed that less than 30% of APIs feel like they are represented in the media.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen our analysis found that most films were accurately cast, it was unexpected and empowering!\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we also know how fragile this progress is. In 2024, racial and gender diversity in Hollywood [decreased for the first time in six years](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/hollywood-diversity-in-decline-as-moviegoers-worldwide-want-more), part of a larger trend of diminishing diversity. Even so, diversity and representation aren’t just about seeing Asian actors on screen. As Constance Wu described in a [recent interview](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/constance-wu-the-friend-movie-hollywood-diversity-rcna198408), “If you think it’s just about trying to check off a box, that’s not what it’s supposed to be and not what it should be.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we lose with this regression isn’t just symbolic; these films help us feel less lonely in experiences and embrace our identities.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether it be seeing my family’s breakfast traditions reflected *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)* or contemplating with friends on *Didi (2024)* about our experiences growing up in immigrant households, these movies have made me, and my community, feel seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I call my mom while trying to recreate the recipes of my childhood, or realize my Shanghainese is getting rusty because I only speak it with family, it’s easy to feel isolated in the struggle to balance my Chinese and American identities. \r\n\r\n\r\nThese movies serve as a powerful affirmation that I am not alone–and that my experiences deserve to be shared and truly understood.","methodology":"Our initial datasets started with [Luminate](https://luminatedata.com/), a database for music and entertainment data that was previously part of Nielsen Media Research. We used this database to find every film featuring a popular Asian actor since 1981. Luminate Data includes information on actors' background and ethnicities, movies they were in, and details about each movie. \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the advanced search feature, we compiled a list of actors that satisfied the conditions of: Films, in Development OR Released Films, Genre is Action OR Comedy OR Drama OR Horror OR Sci Fi/Fantasy OR Thriller, Keywords like Asian Lead Cast, Production Status is Completed, Country of Origin(s) United States, Release Type is THEATRICAL, WIDE, do not include Inactive records. We looked at movies that were released from 1981 through 2023. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur initial list returned too broad of a list, because it included actors who were only in films that were not widely distributed. So we filtered the data based on a metric called ScreenScore—a 1-100 scoring system that measures the popularity and relevance of each actor. It considers factors such as how often the actor is searched, the significance of movies they’ve been in, and any awards they’ve received. We talked to a representative at Luminate who helped us determine that a score of 60 was a reasonable cutoff. This left us with 83 actors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe identified all the movies where these 83 actors were a “Main Title Actor,” meaning they had a significant role in the film. We filtered out movies that had a box office debut of less than $1,000,000 USD, resulting in 371 movies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this methodology was good, we wanted to make sure we didn’t miss any major films. So we added films with Asian actors from the [top-50 highest-grossing films](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2025/) each year, according to IMDB. This gave us **3,582 films**. Of these 2,150 movies, there were 96 movies that ChatGPT classified as having at least one Asian main character that we then added to our list of movies, bringing it to 467 movies. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe then needed to identify the movies that not only had Asian main actors, but also storylines where Asian characters had ethnicities that mattered. While inherently a subjective process, we considered factors such as characters speaking Asian languages, interacting with family, participating in cultural or religious activities, or storylines based in Asian history. We also referenced actor interviews, movie transcripts, online articles, and our best judgement to try and categorize these films. For example, *The Life of Pi (2012)* qualified because the protagonist, Pi, struggles with his Hindu faith and Indian heritage along with other reflections. However, *Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)* did not. While the character Dr. Bravestone is played by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, the plot does not reference the character’s Asian identity at all. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis brought our list from 467 to 80 movies—a huge filtering of our list, but it just showed that a huge portion of films had Asian actors but their ethnicity didn’t matter to the plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur final dataset included 236 Asian characters in the 80 films played by 165 unique actors. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow came the hard part: We needed to find the ethnicity of the actor and compare that to the ethnicity of characters. We did this by XXXXXX. If an actor had at least a partial ethnicity match with a character they played, we considered that a match. There were 11 characters across six movies who we could not determine a specific ethnicity for a character, so we removed them from our data.\r\n\r\n\r\nImages of actors are used under a Creative Commons license, via Wikimedia, courtesy of the following creators: Sarah E.
