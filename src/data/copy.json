Starting in the 1900s, white actors played some of the most prominent Asian characters throughout films, including Charlie Chan and Dr. Fu Manchu. The “Yellowface” practices of the early 1900s were centered around white actors playing up ‘racial’ features, including ‘slanted’ eyes, a yellow skin color, black hair, and a distinct accent. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce Asian Americans did get to play themselves on screen, stereotypes limited the depth of representation; Bruce Lee’s career was limited to portraying a martial arts master and despite Anna May Wong’s popularity, her castings were always that of a ‘Dragon Lady’.","copy2":"These days, movies like Crazy Rich Asians and Everything Everywhere All At Once have garnered support not only throughout the Asian American community, but also had critical international acclaim. Even more promising, in the past 16 years, the percentage of Asian characters with speaking roles increased from 3.4% to 15.9%[1], outpacing growth of any other ethnic group in Hollywood. As of 2021, 7.1% of the US population identifies as Asian American, nearly matched by the 5.9% of Asian speaking characters in top movies from the past 15 years[2]. Movies starring Asian Americans have slowly started to encompass a multifaceted portrayal of the Asian experience, going beyond stereotypes and tokenized characters. As Asian Americans ourselves, this is really exciting!","tier1scrolly":[{"stage":"6","text":"Our data centers around 371 movies starring Asians as main cast have been produced since 1981.

The government recognizes “Asian American” as an official term used in the United States census, and many people identify Asians as a monolith based on the ideas that they “look similar” and have similar backgrounds. However, more than half of Asian Americans identify most by their specific ethnicity, like “Chinese” or “Thai”, not by the term “Asian”.[3] \r\n\r\n\r\nIncreased representation of Asian American stories is undoubtedly a win, but what stood out to us was how this representation can fail to capture nuances of different ethnicities. Let’s look at some examples:","example1":"In Kim’s Convenience, Jung, a Korean character played by a Chinese man, and Kimchee, a Korean character played by a Vietnamese man, both speak broken Korean with poor accents. Specifically Kimchee, named after Korea’s most famous dish, is not only clearly not represented by a Korean person, but also has characteristics that render him a caricature of a Korean man.","example2":"In To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, the movie series includes details around the main character and her two sister’s half Korean heritage through foods like bulgogi and traditional clothing like hanboks. However, none of the actresses who play the three sisters are actually half Korean. While this movie series was a big win in diversity for Asian leads in romantic movies, it was difficult to believe that these three Asian women, with different ethnic backgrounds were Korean or even remotely related[4].","example3":"In Fresh Off the Boat…","copy4":"Inaccurate representation isn’t just just discouraging— it’s damaging. For many, media portrayals are a main source of exposure to Asian cultures. If their portrayals are filled with stereotypes and inaccuracies, they will inevitably lead to the reinforcement of harmful misconceptions, generalizations and biases. When Hollywood substitutes Asian actors to play other Asian characters, this not only impacts who gets to represent their own culture, but also how Asian cultures are received.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note that ‘accurate’ representation has nothing to do with actors looking a certain type of Asian. In fact, this stereotype is exactly what we’re trying to dispute: there is no certain look for a specific ethnicity. Rather, nuance in cultural elements such as language, religion, foods, and social customs impact how Asian ethnicities vary.","copy_datasetup":"Our analysis began with 83 popular Asian actors, the 371 popular movies in which they played main characters, and ultimately focused on 76 of those films where we believed the actors' ethnicities and cultures were invaluable to the storyline.","tier2scrolly":[{"stage":"11","text":"First page, grayed out count: These 76 movies span 22 years and included a total of 221 Asian main characters."},{"stage":"12","text":"Second page, match/no match: Of the 232 Asian main characters, 191— or 86.4%— were portrayed by actors of the same ethnic background."},{"stage":"13","text":"Third, movie grouping: Out of 76 movies, 54 were cast with complete accuracy, and all but three movies featured more accurate casting than not."},{"stage":"14","text":"Third, movie grouping: Out of 76 movies, 54 were cast with complete accuracy, and all but three movies featured more accurate casting than not."},{"stage":"15","text":"Third, movie grouping: Out of 76 movies, 54 were cast with complete accuracy, and all but three movies featured more accurate casting than not."},{"stage":"16","text":"Third, movie grouping: Out of 76 movies, 54 were cast with complete accuracy, and all but three movies featured more accurate casting than not."},{"stage":"17","text":"Third, movie grouping: Out of 76 movies, 54 were cast with complete accuracy, and all but three movies featured more accurate casting than not."}],"conclusion":"Asian representation in Hollywood has continued to expand, and more than 80% of these movies with prominent Asian storylines are accurately cast. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we watch media about Asian stories, we hope to connect with experiences of our own ethnicities and embrace the characters, and the actors playing them. These movies are, and should be, celebrated as a win for Asian representation. But these popular movies don’t always resonate with Asian Americans. Although a small fraction, inaccurately cast movies that we’ve seen have impacts on how we feel represented, and we tend to remember them.","methodology":"Our main data source was Luminate Data, a database for music and entertainment data that was previously part of the Nielsen Media Research. Luminate Data includes information on actors' background and ethnicities, movies they were in, and details about each movie. \r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the advanced search feature, we compiled a list of 83 actors that satisfied the conditions of: Films, in Development OR Released Films, Genre is Action OR Comedy OR Drama OR Horror OR Sci Fi/Fantasy OR Thriller, Keywords like Asian Lead Cast, Production Status is Completed, Country of Origin(s) United States, Release Type is THEATRICAL, WIDE, do not include Inactive records. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe then filtered based on the ScreenScore metric, a 1-100 scoring system that considers factors such as popularity of actors in terms of search frequency, significance of movies they’ve been in, and any awards received. We referenced this as a score of how popular and relevant an actor was, and a call with the representative at Luminate helped us determine that a score of 60 was a reasonable cutoff for actor relevancy. Filtering this initial search for only actors with a ScreenScore of 60+ left us with 83 actors. \r\n\r\n\r\nOf the 83 actors, we identified all the movies where they were a Main Title Actor, which we then whittled down to movies that had a box office debut that did at least $1,000,000 USD, resulting in 371 movies (spreadsheet). \r\n\r\n\r\nThen came the hard part: we needed to identify the movies that not only had Asian Main Actors, but also storylines where Asian characters had ethnicities that mattered. While inherently a subjective process, we considered factors such as characters speaking Asian languages, interacting with family, participating in cultural/religious activities, or any storylines based in Asian history. We also referenced actor interviews or other online articles that discussed “accurate” representation of the cultures. This brought our list from 371 to 76 movies (spreadsheet).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur final dataset was all 232 Asian characters (spreadsheet) and Main Title Actors in the 76 films, comparing ethnicity of characters to that of the actors who played them. There were 11 characters across six movies who we could not determine a specific ethnicity for a character, which we removed from the character/actor data. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few limitations to our methods, firstly that we started with a list of prominent Asian actors and the movies they were in, eliminating joy luck club type movies with no prominent actors\r\nWe measured by box office revenue, so no tv shows or streaming\r\nTier 2 is subjective"}
